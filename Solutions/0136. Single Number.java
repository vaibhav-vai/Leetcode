/*Explaination
The given code is a Java solution to find the single number in an integer array `nums` where all other numbers appear twice.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The method `singleNumber` takes an integer array `nums` as input and returns an integer representing the single number.

2. The code initializes two variables:
   - `l` represents the length of the `nums` array.
   - `res` is initially set to the first element of the `nums` array (`nums[0]`).

3. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the `nums` array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`).

4. Inside the loop, the code performs the bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between the current value of `res` and the current element (`nums[i]`). 
XOR is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different and 0 if they are the same.

5. By performing the XOR operation with each element, the code effectively cancels out the pairs of numbers that appear twice in the array. 
The result will be the single number that appears only once.

6. After iterating over all the elements in `nums`, the value of `res` will be the single number.

7. Finally, the method returns the value of `res`, which represents the single number in the array.

In summary, the code uses the XOR operation to find the single number in the array. XORing a number with itself or with an even number results in 0, 
while XORing it with an odd number leaves the number unchanged. Therefore, XORing all the numbers in the array will cancel out the pairs, 
leaving only the single number. The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`, as it requires a single 
pass through the array. The space complexity is O(1) since the variables used are constant regardless of the input size.
