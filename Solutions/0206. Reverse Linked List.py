ðŸ”¹ Step-by-step Walkthrough
Suppose list is:
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> None

Initial:
curr = 1
prev = None

Iteration 1:
temp = 2
curr.next = prev â†’ 1.next = None
prev = 1
curr = 2
List looks like:
1 -> None
2 -> 3 -> None

Iteration 2:
temp = 3
2.next = 1
prev = 2
curr = 3
List:
2 -> 1 -> None
3 -> None

Iteration 3:
temp = None
3.next = 2
prev = 3
curr = None (loop ends)

Final:
3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None

ðŸ”¹ Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) â†’ one pass through all nodes
Space Complexity: O(1) â†’ only uses a few pointers (prev, curr, temp)
